    "Description": "Hello, my name is Ethan Randolph. I am a Computer Science graduate that has worked in Software Development for the past 3 years. I am one of continuous improvement and am passionate about making core changes that will help improve and expand an existing codebase, project, or company. In the past, I mainly worked with CSUSB in developing research prototypes with virtual reality and the Unreal Engine. That has given me experience with working with a variety of languages including C++, managing projects and developing leadership skills with leading other programmers, interacting with clients for both meeting their needs and giving technical consulting, and developing core infrastructure changes with CI/CD pipelines and general script development. I continued this work with a contract job with GazaXR, LLC, where I worked with improving one of these projects into an experience that they tour around the world, along with setting up their infrastructure with ManageXR and working with various event hosts to ensure smooth deployment. Now, I continue to develop my skills with working on projects that spark an interest with me, like rewriting my website to be full stack and using fun languages like Golang. If you are interested in working with me, my contact information is down below.",

      "Description": "I wanted to convert my existing ReactJS website into a full stack application, because I wanted to have more control of what I wanted to do with it in the future and wanted to make it more optimal for its use-case. I wanted server-sided rendering and a database to manage all my information rather than an ever-increasing json file I had to repeatedly send to viewers. I have begun rewriting the website by using Golang as the webserver. It integrates a module called PGX that acts as the PostgreSQL driver for my database. I decided to use Templ after working with the included html templating module called html/template, after realizing that the structure I had in mind for the templates still resembled Javascript X. Templ fit the bill while remaining completely server-sided. The website is dynamic, depending on what is available in the database, such as /projects/id refering to that project instead of everything loaded immediately like how the previous website handled it. Since the HTML is directly received instead of ReactJS generating it after running client side, it has become more SEO for webcrawlers. Another attention to detail I have been following is ensuring that proper HTML elements are used and alternatives elements are present when a Javascript runtime is not present. For example, there is a Javascript image/video carousel that is fun to look at, but for browsers without javascript, a section with image links is present instead. I want to ensure the website remains accessible in ways like this, something my previous website failed to do. Finally, I decided to try out TailwindCSS for styling it instead of raw CSS like the previous website. While I am still addressing redundancy issues, TailwindCSS has proven to be intuitive for getting the design up quickly. I also have ventured to make a Makefile to help build the various elements for this project, as unlike with the previous website this one does have multiple pieces.",

The user can also use the arrows on the image to teleport to alternate views. The time tracked between the mistakes and sequence are recorded and printed into a log after all mistakes are identified. It also utilizes the Meta Quest Pro's eye tracking and keeps track of what the user is looking at, to help determine where students are observing while trying to look for mistakes.\n I was the programming lead, with a fellow programmer. I handled the base code framework, image loading, editor assets to help place mistake and teleport markers, and player controls. I directed the fellow programmer and guided with tracking eye tracking data and drawing it into a heatmap image.",

The unreal version attempts to recreate and enhance the original Mozilla Hubs version by recreating the core features that were present, and then utilizing the Unreal Engine capabilities to further enhance this vision. The original version utilized Mozilla Hubs to hosted the imagery and videos of Gaza, but it was running into technical limitations. Utilizing PixelStreaming, this version was recreated in Unreal by using PixelStreaming to create the accessibilty that allows people who do not have the desktop or vr hardware to view the enhanced graphics of the Unreal Engine version. In addition epxeriences such as 360 photo spheres were enhanced with C++ (not possible with Mozilla Hubs) to allow the camera to be perfectly centered in the 360 sphere, and allowed the 360 sphere to be expanded client-side and a video to play that replaces the image thumbnail. The Unreal version recreates the multiplayer by taking advantage of Unreal Engine's built-in multiplayer systems, along with Vivox functionality to add excellent free voice chat for this small project. When I stopped working on it, there was much to be added, but I provided the core foundation and functionality that were the biggest concerns with the project. ",

It stays simplified for the course material it was designed for and tests the students on their Biology knowledge to complete the assignment. Students are to go to each organelle and configure it using levers. They will be guided to some extent and given a few tries. After they complete that stage, a new stage occurs that causes an extracellular event. In this case, it was heat stress, and the student will have to reconfigure the cell to adapt to the new situation with new options present and new areas of the cell they can explore. I was the former project lead of this project. I met with the professor on a bi-weekly basis, and designed the systems to read lesson files that store the organelle positions and answers, in case this project was expanded upon. I learned Niagara systems to create many particle systems to add visual flair in the VR headset without taxing it too much from traditional means. I also created a lesson editor, which is an inhouse tool (accessible as a map in the Unreal Engine project files) that allows other developers to easily design different lessons for testing purposes or to create alterations of the existing elements per the client's requests. I also worked with our artist to provide art inspirations based on the professor'srequirements and to ensure that the technical design of the models allowed our programmers to easily adjust them for the spawn systems and visual display.

The 5th player would be one of the people executing the study, watching all 4 players play as an invisible spectator on a standard Windows computer. I was involved for most of its development. I was responsible for altering/upgrading several core concept ideas including changing the motivation systems for the tasks to be based on real-life investments (time and challenge each option would present) rather than something like hunger or thirst like the client's original ideas were (there were no systems planned to punish/reward survival mechanics that hunger and thirst would affect). I was responsible for upgrading the code structure and systems utilizted in this project to be more scalable and modular to our client's and project needs as we continued developing. With my team, we adapted the entire code base of the project into Unreal's multiplayer framework, which would be the xREAL's first foray into multiplayer projects. I along with a collegue, were responsible for determining how adapt the code base by determining how the tasks will translate to other users, how they will load into the server and how the players will be able to interact with each other. I was responsible for initiating the push to include the fifth player for specating and server logging of events.
