      "Description": "The resume generator creates a resume using LaTeX and Python. Python takes in a json file formatted correctly, and then creates a LaTeX document based on the information. It organizes by tags to customize project contents in resume. It also measures line count to ensure it never suprasses it, useful for keeping the resume to 1 page, if one has many projects to show off. The LaTeX document then is processed into a pdf using TexLive. This is paired with my portfolio repo, which has Github Actions to automatically generate new resumes on portfolio update.",

      "Description": " This is the Phoenix of Gaza, a project designed to reveal the inner life of the strip of Gaza that is not normally revealed to the outside world. The unreal version attempts to recreate and enhance the original Mozilla Hubs version by recreating the core features that were present, and then utilizing the Unreal Engine capabilities to further enhance this vision. The original version utilized Mozilla Hubs to hosted the imagery and videos of Gaza, but it was running into technical limitations. Utilizing PixelStreaming, this version was recreated in Unreal by using PixelStreaming to create the accessibilty that allows people who do not have the desktop or vr hardware to view the enhanced graphics of the Unreal Engine version. In addition epxeriences such as 360 photo spheres were enhanced with C++ (not possible with Mozilla Hubs) to allow the camera to be perfectly centered in the 360 sphere, and allowed the 360 sphere to be expanded client-side and a video to play that replaces the image thumbnail. The Unreal version recreates the multiplayer by taking advantage of Unreal Engine's built-in multiplayer systems, along with Vivox functionality to add excellent free voice chat for this small project. When I stopped working on it, there was much to be added, but I provided the core foundation and functionality that were the biggest concerns with the project. ",

      "Description": " This was a project commmission by a Biology professor to reconstruct a cell that a student can explore. It stays simplified for the course material it was designed for and tests the students on their Biology knowledge to complete the assignment. Students are to go to each organelle and configure it using levers. They will be guided to some extent and given a few tries. After they complete that stage, a new stage occurs that causes an extracellular event. In this case, it was heat stress, and the student will have to reconfigure the cell to adapt to the new situation with new options present and new areas of the cell they can explore. I was the former project lead of this project. I met with the professor on a bi-weekly basis, and designed the systems to read lesson files that store the organelle positions and answers, in case this project was expanded upon. I learned Niagara systems to create many particle systems to add visual flair in the VR headset without taxing it too much from traditional means. I also created a lesson editor, which is an inhouse tool (accessible as a map in the Unreal Engine project files) that allows other developers to easily design different lessons for testing purposes or to create alterations of the existing elements per the client's requests. I also worked with our artist to provide art inspirations based on the professor'srequirements and to ensure that the technical design of the models allowed our programmers to easily adjust them for the spawn systems and visual display.

      "Description": "Reconnections is a 5-player multiplayer VR experience that tests the players on making eco-friendly, selfless choices or eco-harmful, selfish choices. Four players strap on the VR headsets to complete these tasks and reach the center of the island, where they will finally be able to see who else was altering the environment around them. The 5th player would be one of the people executing the study, watching all 4 players play as an invisible spectator on a standard Windows computer. I was involved for most of its development. I was responsible for altering/upgrading several core concept ideas including changing the motivation systems for the tasks to be based on real-life investments (time and challenge each option would present) rather than something like hunger or thirst like the client's original ideas were (there were no systems planned to punish/reward survival mechanics that hunger and thirst would affect). I was responsible for upgrading the code structure and systems utilizted in this project to be more scalable and modular to our client's and project needs as we continued developing. With my team, we adapted the entire code base of the project into Unreal's multiplayer framework, which would be the xREAL's first foray into multiplayer projects. I along with a collegue, were responsible for determining how adapt the code base by determining how the tasks will translate to other users, how they will load into the server and how the players will be able to interact with each other. I was responsible for initiating the push to include the fifth player for specating and server logging of events. Towards the latter half of the development cycle, I took on a more managerial position of ensuring the final parts of the projects fit into the codebase developed for the changed requirements of the project.
